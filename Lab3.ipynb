    "### Business Case\n",
    "Class to predict: Target (Dropout, Enrolled, Graduate)\n",
    "\n",
    "Dataset Source: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/697/predict+students+dropout+and+academic+success\n",
    "\n",
    "This data set was made with the intention to predict and prevent studen dropouts and failures in higher education. The data contains basic information about the student and their parents, including socio-economic and demographic information. Our model aims to predict whether a student will **dropout**, **continue enrollment**, or **graduate** from their program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this data, we aim to identify factors that may be correlated to an increased probability of a student dropping out and/or failing out of college or university. It would also be useful to identify which factors may indicate a higher probability of student success. If the factors are something in the student's control, these results can be used by employees in higher education to help students who may be at a higher risk of leaving higher education prematurely. The results could also be used by various non-profits and tutoring companies to aid students who are high risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "Colleges and universities could use this data to increase retention rates. SMU, specifically the Lyle School of Engineering, could utilize this data to make efforts in The Recruitment and Retention Office more effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "This model will be most useful if it is deployed and frequently retrained. If we're able to collect more data as time goes on, we may notice different trends in which variables tend to be stronger indicators of a student's target status. For example, if the inflation rate is high certain years, that may be a strong predictor of the studen'ts target, but if inflation has decreased, other variables may be more important when determining the student's status. The model should be consistently retrained to keep it as up to date and as accurate as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Measure of Reliability\n",
    "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10056943\n",
    "\n",
    "In this article, the researchers sought to predict student performance in higher education. In the literature review section, they referenced multiple other studies that had been done using machine learning. A few of those descriptions included the accuracy of the prediciton models used; in the first, the accuracy was 76.37-82.39%, and on the second, there was an accuracy of 74%. Based on these results, our prediction algorithm should have an accuracy of 75% or greater to be on par with other pre-existing machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Definition and Preparation\n",
    "We removed the following features from the dataset: \n",
    "- **Application mode**- This variable indicated how the student applied to the school/course. This likely does not have an impact on the target variable, particularly when there are more significant variables in the dataset, so we removed it.\n",
    "- **Application order**- This variable indicated how the applicant ranked their school/course choices, with 0 being their first choice and 9 being their last choice. This could potentially play a role in indicating the target variable, but other factors will likely have a more significant impact.\n",
    "- **Curricular units 1st sem (credited), Curricular units 1st sem (evaluations), Curricular units 1st sem (approved), Curricular units 1st sem (without evaluations), Curricular units 2nd sem (credited), Curricular units 2nd sem (evaluations), Curricular units 2nd sem (approved), Curricular units 2nd sem (without evaluations)**- We decided that these variables were safe to be removed because we kept the enrolled curricular units and their respective grades.\n",
    "- **Age at enrollment**- Other variables can give us similar information to this one. Things like marital status can be an indicator of age, and will likely have more of a weight on the student's status than their age."

    "Through research we found that MSE is not commonly used for logistic regression as it does not take into account the probablistic interpretation of the output. MLE is preferred because it provides a better fit for classification tasks which ensures that output probablities are modeled correctly. In doing this it was easier to follow derivations from the MSE to the gradient and finally the Hessian which made it eaiser to understand. Despite this if what we have researched is true then MLE is the preffered method since it yields more accurate results."
